## Style

Follow the GitHub Style guide as much as possible.

1. Avoid commits with trailing or extraneous whitespace.
2. Files should end with a newline.
3. Wrap long lines to ~80 characters.  This makes editing on a laptop or in a
   tmux session easier.
4. Use spaces for indenting; no hard tabs.
3. `and` and `or` are reasonable substitutions for `||` and `&&`.
4. Prefer `["a", "b", "c"]` over `%w(a, b, c)`.
5. Use `""` for interpolated strings and `''` for non-interpolated strings.
